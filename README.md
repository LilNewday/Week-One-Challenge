# Code Refractor Challenge

## Description

This Refractor Challenge addresses accessibility issues on the Horiseon website as well as cleans up some extra coding. This addressed certain concerns with the website by giving it a proper title to find it on the internet, organizing and structuring the HTML elements, and assigning alt attributes to the images. I finally grasped the concept of HTML elements and attributes, as well as how to simplify the amount of CSS that I can use in a code instead of repeating myself for every one little detail.
